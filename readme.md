## Introduction

Parallel computing allows you to perform many calculations simultaneously, leveraging the power of modern multi-core processors and GPUs. CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by NVIDIA. It allows developers to use GPUs for general purpose processing.

This repository aims to provide a structured path to learn parallel computing and CUDA programming from scratch. Whether you're a beginner or have some experience, you'll find valuable resources and practical examples to enhance your understanding.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with C/C++ programming languages
- Basic understanding of computer architecture
- Familiarity with algorithms and data structures
- A CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU
